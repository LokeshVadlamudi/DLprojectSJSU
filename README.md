# DLprojectSJSU (Project is trained on TPU)

**Project Name** : Tin Machine (Automating Tinder Swipes)

**Team Members** : Lokesh Vadlamudi, Nupur Yadav

We trained several models using FastAi and Keras libraries to come up with the best model for our image classification task. Following are the links to corresponding colabs:

Following is the link to final colab where we are getting the images from Tinder account using xauth token id and doing data annotation, data preprocessing, loading the best model  and doing the final inference.
